# 3. Special Situations
## Experienced Candidates

 - algorithm questions
	 - experienced candidate (slightly prepared)
	 - unexperienced candidate
	 - skills demonstrated in questions are important for all developers.
 - exception
	 - system design & architecture questions
	 - student does not study much about system architecture
	 - performance in interview questions = experience level
 - experienced candidate will be expected to give more depth impressive response

## Tester & SDETs

 - SDET: software design engineers in test
	 - test features instead of build features
 - Strong communication skill
- Career advice
	- difficult to move from an SDET to dev position
	- keep your coding and algorithms skills very sharp

## Product ( & Program ) Management

- Skill Needed:
	- Handling ambiguity
		- don't get overwhelmed and stall
		- tackle the problem head on
		- seeking new information
		- priotizing the most important parts
		- solving the problem in a structured way
	
	- Customer Focus	(Attitude)
		- be sure to ask a lot of questions to understand who the customer is and how they are using
	
	- Customer Focus (Technical Skills)
		- strong understanding of product
		- Window Security (understanding of security)
		- requisite skills
	
	- Multi-Level Communication
		- able to communicate with people at all levels
		- flexibility in your communication
		- "Explain TCP/IP to your grandmother"

	- Passion of Technology
		- enthusiasm
		- eager to face the job's challenge
	
	- Teamwork/Leadership
		- most important aspect
		- ability to work well with other people
		- "Tell me a bout a time when a teammate wasn't pulling his/ her own weight"
		- can handle conflict wells
		- preparing for behavioral questions will be extremely important
		
## Dev Lead and Managers 
  - Strong coding and algorithm skills are almost always required
  - Skill Needed:
	  - Teamwork/Leadership
		  - will be examined implicitly and explicitly
		  - Explicit: how you handled prior situations ("When you disagree with your manager")
		  - Implicit: interviewers watching how you interact with them.

	- Prioritization
		- often faced with tricky issues
		- whether you can prioritize a project appropriately
		- to understand what is critical and what you can reasonably expect to accomplish

	- Communication
		- see whether you can communicate at many levels
		- can do so in a way that is friendly and engaging

	- "Getting Things Done"
		- striking the right balance between preparing for a project and actually implementing it.
		- need to understand how to structure a project
		- how to motivate people to accomplish goals

# 4. Before the Interview
## Getting the Right Experience
1. Students
- Take the Big Project
	- Seek out the classes with big coding project
	- get practical experience

- Get Internship
- Start Something
	- Hackathons
	- open source project
	- important that you are coding
	
2. Professional
- Shift Work Responsibilities More Toward Coding
	- ensure project are "meaty"
	- project that will form the bulk of your resume

- Use your night and weekends
	- build a mobile app, web app, a piece of desktop software.
	- write in your resume who built something "just for fun"

## Writing a Resume
- prepare your resume to indicate you are smart and you can code
- technical lines > non technical hobby
## Appropriate Resume Length
- 1.5~2pages
- recruiters use only around 10 seconds
- prioritize content

## Employment History
### Writing Strong Bullets
- include relevant positions
- Example: 
	- Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z
- Show what you did# 3. Special Situations

- technical lines > non technical hobby
## Appropriate Resume Length
- 1.5~2pages
- recruiters use only around 10 seconds
- prioritize content

## Employment History
### Writing Strong Bullets
- include relevant positions
- Example: 
	- Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z
- Show what you did
- How you did
- What the results (measurable)

## Projects
- Project section in your resume
- 2-4 most significant projects
- what the project, which language, technology it employed
- details for project
- employers like open source projects (experience contributing to a large code base)
- prefer independent projects (easier to understand your personal contributions)

## Programming Languages and Software
### Software
- Visual studio / Eclpise
- top companies wont even care

### Languages
- listing everything you have ever worked with is dangerous
- shorten the list just the one that you're most comfortable with
- Example:
	- Java (expert), C++ (Proficient), JavaScript ( prior experience )

### Beware of (Potential) Stigma
1. Enterprise Languages
	- Visual Basic = less skill
	- .NET platform = do more to show that you're strong technically
2. Being Too Language Focused
	- Best software engineer does not define themselves around a particular language
3. Certifications
	- some companies are bias with specific technologies
4. Knowing only One or Two Languages
	- resume with only 1 language = have not experienced very many problems

### Preparation Map => check book

# 5. Behavioral Question (skip)
