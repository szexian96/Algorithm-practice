# 3. Special Situations
## Experienced Candidates

 - algorithm questions
	 - experienced candidate (slightly prepared)
	 - unexperienced candidate
	 - skills demonstrated in questions are important for all developers.
 - exception
	 - system design & architecture questions
	 - student does not study much about system architecture
	 - performance in interview questions = experience level
 - experienced candidate will be expected to give more depth impressive response

## Tester & SDETs

 - SDET: software design engineers in test
	 - test features instead of build features
 - Strong communication skill
- Career advice
	- difficult to move from an SDET to dev position
	- keep your coding and algorithms skills very sharp

## Product ( & Program ) Management

- Skill Needed:
	- Handling ambiguity
		- don't get overwhelmed and stall
		- tackle the problem head on
		- seeking new information
		- priotizing the most important parts
		- solving the problem in a structured way
	
	- Customer Focus	(Attitude)
		- be sure to ask a lot of questions to understand who the customer is and how they are using
	
	- Customer Focus (Technical Skills)
		- strong understanding of product
		- Window Security (understanding of security)
		- requisite skills

## Dev Lead and Managers 
  - Strong coding and algorithm skills are almost always required
  - Skill Needed:
	  - Teamwork/Leadership
		  - will be examined implicitly and explicitly
		  - Explicit: how you handled prior situations ("When you disagree with your manager")
		  - Implicit: interviewers watching how you interact with them.

	- Prioritization
		- often faced with tricky issues
		- whether you can prioritize a project appropriately
		- to understand what is critical and what you can reasonably expect to accomplish

	- Communication
		- see whether you can communicate at many levels
		- can do so in a way that is friendly and engaging

	- "Getting Things Done"
		- striking the right balance between preparing for a project and actually implementing it.

# 4. Before the Interview
## Getting the Right Experience
1. Students
- Take the Big Project
	- Seek out the classes with big coding project
	- get practical experience

- Get Internship
- Start Something
	- Hackathons
	- open source project
	- important that you are coding
	
2. Professional
- Shift Work Responsibilities More Toward Coding
	- ensure project are "meaty"
	- project that will form the bulk of your resume

- Use your night and weekends
	- build a mobile app, web app, a piece of desktop software.
	- write in your resume who built something "just for fun"

## Writing a Resume
- prepare your resume to indicate you are smart and you can code
- technical lines > non technical hobby
## Appropriate Resume Length
- 1.5~2pages
- recruiters use only around 10 seconds
- prioritize content

## Employment History
### Writing Strong Bullets
- include relevant positions
- Example: 
	- Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z
- Show what you did# 3. Special Situations

## Writing a Resume
- prepare your resume to indicate you are smart and you can code
- technical lines > non technical hobby
## Appropriate Resume Length
- 1.5~2pages
- recruiters use only around 10 seconds
- prioritize content

## Employment History
### Writing Strong Bullets
- include relevant positions
- Example: 
	- Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z
- Show what you did
- How you did
- What the results (measurable)

## Projects
- Project section in your resume
- 2-4 most significant projects
- what the project, which language, technology it employed
- details for project
- employers like open source projects (experience contributing to a large code base)
- prefer independent projects (easier to understand your personal contributions)

## Programming Languages and Software
### Software
- Visual studio / Eclpise
- top companies wont even care

### Languages
- listing everything you have ever worked with is dangerous
- shorten the list just the one that you're most comfortable with
- Example:
	- Java (expert), C++ (Proficient), JavaScript ( prior experience )

### Beware of (Potential) Stigma
1. Enterprise Languages
	- Visual Basic = less skill
	- .NET platform = do more to show that you're strong technically
2. Being Too Language Focused
	- Best software engineer does not define themselves around a particular language
3. Certifications
	- some companies are bias with specific technologies
4. Knowing only One or Two Languages
	- resume with only 1 language = have not experienced very many problems

### Preparation Map => check book

# 5. Behavioral Question (skip)
# 6.Big O (Algorithm)

## Analogy
- Small file: use email, ftp
- Large file: 1TB( it can took maybe 1 day)　⇒ take flight?
- how much faster to transfer a file with physical transfer or electronic transfer

## Time Complexity
Concept of asymptotic runtime aka big O time

### Electronics Transfer O(s)
- the time to transfer the file increase linearly with size

### Airplane Transfer O(1)
- size of file increase but it won't take any longer to get the file to your friend
- time is constant

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*yiyfZodqXNwMouC0-B0Wlg.png" width="400"/>

※O(1)=Airplane Transfer O(1) Electronics Transfer O(s)

### Multiple runtimes
- O(log N)
- O(N log N)
- O(N)
- O($N^2$)
- O($2^N$)
- no fixed possible runtime
  - Time to paint a fence $w$ meter wide $h$ meters high
    - O($wh$)
  - $p$ layers of paint
    - Time = O($whp$)

### Best Case, Worse Case and Expected Case
Describe our runtime for an algorithm in 3 different ways

・ Perspective of Quick Sort
1. Quick Sort picks a random element as a pivot
2. Swaps value in the array that element less that pivot or greater than pivot => Partial sort
3. Recursively sort left and right using similar process.

- Best Case
  - all elements are equal
  - quick sort will on average traverse the array once
  - $O(N)$ :run very quickly on a sorted array

- Worst Case
  - pivot is the biggest element in the array
  - pivot is the first element in subarray
  - array is sorted in reverse order
  - recursion cannot divide the array in half and recurse on each half
  - shrinks the subarray by 1 element
  - $O(N^2)$ runtime

- Expected Case
  - pivot will be very low or very high, but it won't happen over and over
  - $O(N log N)$ runtime

## Space Complexity
- the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm
- parallel concept to time complexity
  - create an array of size n, this will require O(n)space
  - 2D array of size nxn, require $O(N^2)$ space.

Code like this would take $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space
 
~~~
int sum(int n) {  /*ex1*/
	if (n <= 0){
		return 0;
	}
	return n +sum(n-1);
}
~~~

Each call is added to the call stack and take up actually memory

~~~
sum(4)
	-> sum(3)
		-> sum(2)
			-> sum(1)
				->sum(0)
~~~

n calls total doesnot mean it take $O(n)$ space<br>
Below function, which adds adjacent elements between 0 and n(把0和n加起來):

~~~
int parSumSequence(int n) { /*ex2*/
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
		sum += pairSUm(i, i + 1);
	}
	return sum;
}

int pairSum(int a, int b){
	return a + b;
}
~~~

$O(n)$ calls to pairSum. call does not exist simultaneously on the call stack so only need $O(1)$ space.
